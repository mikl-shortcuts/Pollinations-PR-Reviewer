# Pollinations PR Reviewer

AI-powered code reviews for your GitHub Pull Requests using [Pollinations AI](https://pollinations.ai).

No servers to deploy. No infrastructure. Just a workflow file and an API key.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get a Pollinations API key

Go to [Pollinations Dashboard](https://enter.pollinations.ai) or [Pollinations CLI](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/tree/main/packages/polli-cli) and create an API key.

### 2. Add the key to your repo secrets

Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**

- Name: `POLLINATIONS_API_KEY`
- Value: your `sk_...` key

### 3. Create the workflow file

Create `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: AI PR Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
  checks: write

jobs:
  review:
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'pull_request' ||
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '/review'))
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: AI Code Review
        uses: mikl-shortcuts/Pollinations-PR-Reviewer@v1
        with:
          pollinations-api-key: ${{ secrets.POLLINATIONS_API_KEY }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Commit, push, open a PR. Done.

## How It Works

```
You open a PR
      ↓
GitHub triggers this Action
      ↓
Action reads the PR diff via GitHub API
      ↓
Diff is sent to Pollinations AI for analysis
      ↓
Review is posted as a comment + check run on your PR
```

---

## Features

- **Automatic reviews** on PR open and new commits
- **On-demand reviews** via `/review` comment
- **Split review mode** for large PRs — reviews file-by-file, then synthesizes
- **GitHub Check Runs** with inline annotations
- **Formal PR reviews** with approve/request changes
- **Smart file filtering** to skip generated files
- **Retry with backoff** for transient API errors
- **Request timeout** protection with configurable limits
- **Reasoning support** for models utilizing reasoning effort
- **Verdict extraction** (APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / COMMENT)

## API Key Types

| Type | Where to Get It? | Prefix | Use Case | Rate Limit |
|------|------------|--------|----------|------------|
| Secret | [Pollinations Dashboard](https://enter.pollinations.ai/#keys) | `sk_` | Server-side (recommended) | None |
| Publishable | [Pollinations CLI](https://github.com/pollinations/pollinations/tree/main/packages/polli-cli#account) or [Pollinations API](https://gen.pollinations.ai/docs#tag/account/POST/account/keys) | `pk_` | Client-side apps | 1 pollen/IP/hour |

Use a `sk_` key stored as a GitHub secret. Never commit API keys.

## FAQ

**Where do I get my first Pollinations API key?**
[Pollinations Dashboard](https://enter.pollinations.ai) — sign in and create a key.

**How much does it cost?**
Each review consumes Pollen. Cost depends on model and diff size. Check models pricing at [Pollinations Models List](https://enter.pollinations.ai/#models) and your balance at [Pollinations Wallet](https://enter.pollinations.ai/#pollen).

**What models can I use?**
Any model that avaiable at [Pollinations Models List](https://enter.pollinations.ai/#models).

**Is my code sent to a third party?**
Yes, the PR diff is sent to Pollinations AI for analysis. You can check [Pollinations Privacy Policy](https://pollinations.ai/privacy) for more information.

**What about large PRs?**
With `split-review: true` (default), large PRs are reviewed file-by-file and findings are merged. This produces better results than truncating.

**The review didn't appear — what happened?**
Check the Actions tab for error logs. Common issues:
- Invalid API key
- Insufficient pollen balance
- Missing `permissions` block in workflow
- API timeout on very large diffs (can be resolved by increasing the `timeout` setting)

**Can I use this in a private repo?**
Yes. You can check [Pollinations Privacy Policy](https://pollinations.ai/privacy) for more information.
